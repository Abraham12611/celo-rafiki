# 🎬 Celo Rafiki: Pitch & Demo Script

**Duration:** 2 - 3 Minutes

---

## 1. Intro: The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
**Visual:** Close up of the speaker or a high-quality graphic showing global maps and high fee percentages (10-15%).
**Script:**
"Sending money home shouldn’t feel like a robbery. For millions of people in emerging markets, traditional remittances through Western Union or Wise are slow, expensive, and buried in complex forms. 

Blockchain promised a fix, but seed phrases and 0x addresses are just another barrier.

Meet **Celo Rafiki**. The AI 'Concierge Banker' that makes global payments as simple as sending a text."

---

## 2. The Solution: Rafiki (0:30 - 1:00)
**Visual:** Screen recording of the Telegram bot starting.
**Script:**
"Rafiki is a multi-lingual AI agent built on Celo. It lives where users already are—in Telegram and WhatsApp. 

It handles the entire remittance lifecycle using natural language. No more copying addresses or figuring out gas fees. Rafiki uses **SocialConnect** to resolve phone numbers to wallets and **Mento Protocol** to swap between global stablecoins instantly."

---

## 3. Demo 1: Multi-Lingual Intent (1:00 - 1:30)
**Visual:** Screen recording typing in different languages.
**Script:**
"Watch how Rafiki handles global users. 
In English: *'Send $5 to my brother in Kenya.'* 
In Spanish: *'Envía 10 euros a mamá.'*

Rafiki’s AI engine, powered by Llama 3, instantly parses the intent. It identifies the amount, the currency, and the recipient. It doesn't just translate; it understands financial context."

---

## 4. Demo 2: The Magic (Swaps & ID) (1:30 - 2:00)
**Visual:** Show the 'Searching SocialConnect' and 'Executing Swap' messages.
**Script:**
"The magic happens under the hood. Rafiki uses Celo’s **ODIS** to resolve that phone number into a secure blockchain address. 

But what if the recipient needs a different currency? Rafiki triggers an atomic swap via **Mento**, converting cUSD to cEUR or cREAL on the fly. The sender gets convenience; the recipient gets exactly what they need."

---

## 5. The "Above & Beyond": Trust & Savings (2:00 - 2:30)
**Visual:** Show the 'Savings Audit' receipt and the 'Sign with MiniPay' button.
**Script:**
"To top it off, Rafiki provides a **Savings Audit** for every transaction, showing users exactly how many dollars they saved compared to traditional banks.

And for security? We offer **MiniPay Deep-Linking**. Users can choose to let the agent sign for them, OR click a link to sign the transaction trustlessly inside their own Opera MiniPay or Valora wallet. 

Non-custodial security, with AI-driven simplicity."

---

## 6. Outro: The Vision (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual:** Rafiki Logo with the text: "Remittances. Reimagined."
**Script:**
"Celo Rafiki isn't just a bot; it’s a bridge to financial inclusion for the next billion users. Built on Celo, powered by OpenClaw.

Jambo! Join us in making the global economy accessible to everyone."

### Tips for Filming:
1. **Clear Audio:** Use a good mic; the AI/remittance space is crowded, so clarity matters.
2. **Speed:** Keep the screen recordings fast-paced.
3. **Contrast:** Use a dark theme for Telegram to make the text pop.
